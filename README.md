# STABLE WEB3 EXTENSIONS

## Purpose

This repository is dedicated to hosting stable versions of Web3 Chrome extensions that are confirmed to work with the page objects defined by the playwright-web3 library. It is designed to prevent breaking changes during automated testing processes.

## Usage

These extensions are intended primarily for testing purposes in conjunction with your automation code. To ensure consistency in your tests, you can utilize these extensions to avoid issues related to updates in the selectors or logic that might occur with newer versions.

Caution: It is recommended to use these extensions solely for testing scenarios. If possible, always opt to download the latest versions of these extensions directly from the official Chrome Web Store or the developer’s website for other purposes.

For more information on how these extensions are integrated and used within the playwright-web3 framework, please visit the library’s official npm package page: playwright-web3 on npm.
